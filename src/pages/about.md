Hi! I do red team stuff during the day but I'm also an avid gym-goer and an average enjoyer of coffee.

My entire journey started by taking a Cisco networking class at a local community college in the summer of 2017. From there I've achieved various certifications such as CySA+ and CCNA Security, and eventually made my way to join the CCDC team at CPP after high school.

I studied at CPP from 2019 to 2023, where I led a student organization called [SWIFT](https://www.calpolyswift.org/) for a couple years and also competed in CCDC and CPTC through [CPP Cyber](https://cysec.team/) throughout college. While most of my early background included network infrastructure and security engineering, a twist of fate has led me to focus on offensive security during my last few years at CPP.

Now, I'm an Associate Red Team Consultant at CrowdStrike and I help out with events like [WRCCDC](https://wrccdc.org/) as a red teamer.

I've had the utmost pleasure to work with some of the brightest minds during my time at CPP, whose blogs can be found below:

## About this blog

This blog will contain anything related to my technical and personal learning experiences. While my current focus lies within offensive security, in the past I've worked with cloud infrastructure, networking, and other random stuff.

I'm also heavily passionate about the ephemeral, hands-on nature of learning cyber - that you must **seek for understanding** instead of expecting knowledge when it's merely presented to you.
