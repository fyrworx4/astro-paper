Hi! I'm currently a Red Team Consultant at CrowdStrike. Outside work, I enjoy going to the gym, finding the best boba spots, snowboarding, playing pickleball, and sometimes taking my motorcycle out for a spin.

My journey began with Cisco and CompTIA courses at a local community college in the summer of 2017. I've obtained certs like CySA+ and CCNA Security and made my way into Cal Poly Pomona's CCDC team.

At CPP between 2019 and 2023, I was involved with a cybersecurity club known as [SWIFT](https://calpolyswift.org) as well as the [CCDC and CPTC competition teams](https://cysec.team), where our CPTC team placed 1st globally in [2022](https://www.rit.edu/news/worlds-best-cybersecurity-students-battle-collegiate-pentesting-competition-rochester) and [2023](https://www.rit.edu/news/collegiate-penetration-testing-competition-rit-crowns-globes-top-cyber-students).

Throughout my career, I've had the utmost pleasure to work with some of the brightest minds whose blogs can be found below:
