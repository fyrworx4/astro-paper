Hi! I do red teaming during the day but I also enjoy lifting weights, coffee, and thai tea.

My journey began with Cisco and CompTIA courses at a local community college in the summer of 2017 during high school. I've obtained certs like CySA+ and CCNA Security and made my way into the CCDC team at Cal Poly Pomona after high school.

At CPP between 2019 and 2023, I was involved with a cybersecurity club known as [SWIFT](https://calpolyswift.org) as well as the [CCDC and CPTC competition teams](https://cysec.team), where our CPTC team had made some notable achievements such as placing 1st globally in [2022](https://www.rit.edu/news/worlds-best-cybersecurity-students-battle-collegiate-pentesting-competition-rochester) and [2023](https://www.rit.edu/news/collegiate-penetration-testing-competition-rit-crowns-globes-top-cyber-students).

Now, I'm an Associate Red Team Consultant at CrowdStrike and I help out with events like [WRCCDC](https://wrccdc.org/) as a red teamer.

I've had the utmost pleasure to work with some of the brightest minds during uni and work, whose blogs can be found below:

## About this blog

This blog will contain anything related to my technical and personal learning experiences. While my current focus lies within offensive security, you may see posts about cloud infrastructure, networking, and other random stuff.

I'm also heavily passionate about the ephemeral, hands-on nature of learning cyber - that you must **seek for understanding** instead of expecting knowledge when it's merely presented to you.
